# Not Actually Kilo

I've been meaning to brush up on my C/C++. I saw [this guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) on building antirez's [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) text editor from scratch, and thought that was a great way to remember all the things I had forgotten since [college](https://www.lockhaven.edu/).

I'm currently on [step 4](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/04.aTextViewer.html), but taking a break from this since I'm back on a [shapeup](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) cycle at [work](https://www.retailzipline.com).

Will see if I decide to pick this back up and finish it once the cycle is done. I think I got what I came for though. If I want to continue learning a non-gc system language, I'd probably try [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) again (and see if I can figure out how to stop fighting with the [borrow checker](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html) this time...) Maybe there's a straightforward way to convert this project to Rust when I pick it back up? ðŸ¤”
